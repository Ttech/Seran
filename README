SERAN .001

IRC Stats System desigined to run as a IRC bot instead of a Service
this allows it to run on any system and server as long as you can
install ii (fifo irc client) to allow the system to communicate
with the irc server. Any channel will work and the bot does not 
need to be in the channel, simply make sure the channel is not +s
or +p or other private / secret channel modes.
